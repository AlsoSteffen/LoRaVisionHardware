# LoRaVisionHardware

This project was split up into 3 subgroups one of them being hardware which is comprised of:
1. Costandino Hiripis
2. Christof Du Toit
3. Isaac Semackor

These three individial worked as a team to design, build, code and document the assignment provided by Adri Wischmann.

## Assignment
FILLMEIN


### Components
From this assignment above the three individials derived a list of components which include: 
- DS18B20
- Resistors
- Buck Convertor
- Relay

Each component serves a different purpose as descibed in the chapters below

#### DS18B20

#### Resistors

#### Buck Convertor

#### Relay

## Design
Within this phase the team used thier knowledge acquired from the research phase to create a visulaization of the circuit in order to ensure the smooth progression of the build phase.

### Visualization

## Arduino IDE Setup
The first step you will need to do is to download the latest verison of the Arduino IDE (Version 1.8 or higher).
You can download the Arduino IDE with the following link:
http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

After you have downloaded and installed the latest version of Arduino IDE, you will need to start the IDE and navigate to the Preferences menu. You can access it from the File menu in Windows or Linux, or the Arduino menu on OS X.
